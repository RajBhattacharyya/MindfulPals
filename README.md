# MindfulPals 🚀🐾

Welcome to the Virtual Pet Therapy Project! Our open-source initiative is dedicated to providing a virtual companion and therapeutic experience for kids who may feel lonely or prefer introverted activities. The project integrates emotion recognition using machine learning with a React-based frontend and a supportive generative chat model to create a holistic and engaging environment for users.

## Project Overview 🌟

### Features 🎉

- **Emotion Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning to identify and respond to users' emotions through facial expressions.
- **Virtual Companion:** Offers a virtual pet that provides companionship and responds to users' emotional states.
- **User Authentication:** Securely handles user registration, login, and personalized user profiles.
- **Generative Chat:** Engages users in therapeutic conversations with a generative chat model to provide support and guidance.

### Technologies Used 💻
